Description: {project.get('description', '') or 'N/A'}
Deadline: {project.get('deadline', 'N/A')} ({days_remaining} days away)

Active team members and their roles:
{member_list}

Your job:
1. Summarize what the team accomplished today.
2. Identify blockers and — critically — name the person who can unblock each one.
3. Flag cross-person dependencies (person A is waiting on person B).
4. Highlight any deadline risk given the progress reported.
5. Welcome any member submitting for the first time today with a warm one-line mention.
6. Flag any member who did not submit and note that the team is missing their update.
7. State the overall risk level: Low, Medium, or High.

Be direct and specific. Use names. Do not just summarize each person separately — find connections across the team. 

Format the output like this example:

Team brief — {date.today().strftime('%a %d %b')} ({len(submissions)} submitted, {len(missing)} missing)

🔴 Blocker detected: [Name specific blockers and who can unblock them]

🟢 On track: [What's progressing well]

Tomorrow's plan:
- [Member name] — [their plan]

[Missing member names] — no update submitted.

Deadline: {project.get('deadline', 'N/A')} — {days_remaining} days remaining. Risk level: [Low/Medium/High]."""
